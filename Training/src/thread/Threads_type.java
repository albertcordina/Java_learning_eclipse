/*
 * 
 *  Threads are performing action;
 *  Accepted value of priority for a thread is in range of 1 to 10. There are 3 static variables defined in Thread class for priority.
public static int MIN_PRIORITY: This is minimum priority that a thread can have. Value for this is 1.
public static int NORM_PRIORITY: This is default priority of a thread if do not explicitly define it. Value for this is 5.
public static int MAX_PRIORITY: This is maximum priority of a thread. Value for this is 10.

Thread with highest priority will get execution chance prior to other threads. 
Suppose there are 3 threads t1, t2 and t3 with priorities 4, 6 and 1. So, thread t2 
will execute first based on maximum priority 6 after that t1 will execute and then t3.
Default priority for main thread is always 5, it can be changed later. 
Default priority for all other threads depends on the priority of parent thread.
 *  
 *  If two threads have same priority then we canâ€™t expect which thread will execute first.
 *  
 *   At any given time, the highest priority thread is running. However, this is not guaranteed. 
 *   The thread scheduler may choose to run a lower priority thread to avoid starvation. 
 *   For this reason, use priority only to affect scheduling policy for efficiency purposes.
 *   
 *   A higher priority thread has a better chance of being executed before lower priority threads. 
 *   However, it's important to remember that priority alone does not determine the order of thread execution.
 *
